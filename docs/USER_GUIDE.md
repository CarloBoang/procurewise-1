## 1. Introduction & Architectural Framework

**ProcureWise** is the official digital procurement management system of **Batanes State College (BSC)**. It digitizes, automates, and provides strict accountability controls across the entire procurement lifecycle—from annual planning to project archiving.

### Regulatory & Institutional Foundations:
1. **Republic Act No. 12009 (New Government Procurement Act / NGPA)**: Enforces open contracting, digital transparency, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM / MEARB), and strict prohibitions against the artificial splitting of requisitions (Section 5.1.1).
2. **BSC Institutional Procedures 5.1 through 5.15**: Dictates the exact division of responsibilities across nine specialized procurement roles.
3. **Commission on Audit (COA) Circulars**: Mandates documentary completeness (Appendix 60 PR, Quotations, Abstract of Canvass, Purchase Orders, and Inspection & Acceptance Reports).

---

### Phase 1: PPMP Upload & Purchase Request (End-User)

Under RA 12009 and BSC Institutional Policy, **no Purchase Request can be initiated without a verified Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP)**. ProcureWise enforces this through a 2-Step requisition wizard:

#### Step 1: PPMP Prerequisite Gate
1. Navigate to **Requisitions** $\rightarrow$ Click **"+ New Purchase Request"** (or click **"Upload Department PPMP"** in the top action bar).
2. Choose your PPMP Mode:
   - **Upload Own Department PPMP (Recommended for new projects)**:
     - Drag & drop or browse your PPMP file (`.pdf`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.docx`, or scan image up to 14MB).
     - Enter the **Project Title** (e.g., *"Procurement of Laboratory Equipment for College of Engineering"*).
     - Select your **Department / Office** (e.g., *College of Engineering*).
     - Enter the **Fiscal Year** (e.g., *2026*).
     - Select the **Object of Expenditure** (e.g., *5-02-03-010 Office Supplies Expense*).
     - Enter the **Planned PPMP Budget Ceiling (₱)** (e.g., *₱250,000.00*).
   - **Select Registered PPMP**:
     - Choose from previously approved PPMP entries already registered in the system for your department.
3. Click **"Confirm PPMP & Proceed to Purchase Request →"**.
4. The system locks in your verified PPMP baseline and advances you to Step 2.

#### Step 2: PR Formulation Bound to PPMP
1. **Active Verified PPMP Banner**:
   - The top banner displays the verified PPMP Title, Office, Fiscal Year, and Budget Ceiling.
   - If you need to make changes, click `[Change / Re-upload PPMP]`.
2. **Item Specification & Canvas (Appendix 60)**:
   - Use the **PhilGEPS Virtual Store Search** bar to check standard government descriptions and price reference ceilings.
   - Enter **Item Description**, **Unit of Measure** (e.g., *pcs, reams, units*), **Quantity**, and **Estimated Unit Cost**.
   - The system automatically calculates total estimated cost and runs the **Budget Ceiling Safeguard**:
     - *If PR Total > PPMP Ceiling*: A prominent warning appears preventing budget overruns.
3. **Section 5.1.1 Anti-Splitting Segregation Check**:
   - The system warns you if items from different procurement categories are bundled inappropriately.
4. **Signatories & Supporting Documents**:
   - Select your Recommending Approver and Head of Office.
   - Attach your preliminary market scan or pre-canvass quotation files if already conducted.
5. Click **"Submit Purchase Request for Verification"**.
6. The system generates a unique **PR Tracking Token** (e.g., `PR-2026-ENG-0012`) and transmits the package to Procurement Officer II.

---

   - **Budget Ceiling Check**: Verifies that the PR total does not exceed the allotted PPMP allocation.
   - **Item Specifications**: Verifies that specifications are generic and do not reference proprietary brand names (strictly prohibited under RA 12009).
4. **Action Selection**:
   - **Verify & Endorse**: Enter verification findings and click **"Approve & Endorse to Procurement Staff"**. The PR status transitions to `verified`.
   - **Return for Revision**: Provide clear, specific corrective instructions in the remarks box and click **"Return to End-User"**. The PR is returned to the End-User for adjustment with all remarks logged in the audit trail.

5. **System Audit Trail**: Inspect immutable system logs recording every status change, document upload, and user login timestamp.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting, Error Resolution & FAQ

### Q1: Why is the "Confirm PPMP & Proceed to Purchase Request" button disabled?
- **Cause**: Either you have not attached a PPMP file or you have left one of the mandatory fields blank (Project Title, Department, Fiscal Year, Expenditure Object, or Budget Ceiling).
- **Fix**: Fill in all required fields and ensure the uploaded file has finished loading (shows the green badge).

### Q2: Why does the system say "PR Total Exceeds PPMP Budget Ceiling"?
- **Cause**: The combined item quantities and estimated costs in Step 2 exceed the budget ceiling specified in Step 1.
- **Fix**: Adjust item quantities, reduce estimated unit prices, or click `[Change / Re-upload PPMP]` if your approved PPMP has a higher ceiling.

### Q3: Why am I getting an "Invalid Institutional Email Domain" error during signup?
- **Cause**: Self-registration is restricted to verified college faculty and personnel with an authorized `@bsc.edu.ph` address.
- **Fix**: Register using your official Batanes State College email address, or contact the System Administrator for pre-provisioned access.

### Q4: I uploaded an Excel file for my PPMP, but I need to replace it. How do I do that?
- **Fix**: In Step 2 of the requisition wizard, click the red **`[Change / Re-upload PPMP]`** button at the top right of the Active Verified PPMP Banner. This takes you back to Step 1 where you can upload a new file.

### Q5: How do I export documents for Commission on Audit (COA) inspection?
- **Fix**: Authorized roles (Officer II, Staff, BAC, Admin) can click the **"Export PDF"** button on any completed PR, Abstract, or Purchase Order screen to download the official print-ready document.
